# Comparing Machine Learning Methods for Fake News Detection

#### Krystal Dowling, Charlotte Williams, Laura Heard, Yifan Luo

##### In a world of COVID-19 and an increasingly polarised and unstable political climate, fake news has become a real and credible threat to citizen liberty and health. It continues to disseminate insidious disinformation within a public sphere that increasingly turns to online social media for news. This projects seeks to find the best performing classifier to detect fake news.

#### 1. Statistical Machine Learning

Various Statistical Machine Learning models were attempted in fake news detection, from a baseline Naive Bayes model to the final best performing model; a Support Vector Machine.

#### 2. Convolutional Neural Network

Various CNN models were attempted in fake news detection, starting at a simple standard model and building on this model to the final best performing model; a multi-channel CNN.
